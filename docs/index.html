				<p>I know, not <i>another</i> JavaScript library for Bootstrap modals, right?</p>
				<p>However, I found that existing libraries seem to be no longer updated/supported, for older versions of Bootstrap, and/or still require jQuery. So, I decided to write my own for Bootstrap 5, using all native JavaScript and native Bootstrap markup and CSS - there is no custom styling.</p>
				<p><s>I should mention that both the standard and module versions of the library are using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#browser_compatibility" target="_mozdev">newer JavaScript features</a> (as of this writing) which are only supported in more recent versions of the major browsers; like class structures, including private fields and methods.</s></p>
				<p><s>That said, I have also included a compatibility version of the library transpiled by Babel, if needed.  It targets the versions of all major browsers which first included class support (for specifics, check out the <a href="https://github.com/erobertson42/bootstrap-modbox/blob/main/Gruntfile.js" target="_gruntfile">Grunt configuration file</a>).  I <i>did not</i> go back as far as ES5, because Bootstrap 5 no longer supports it either.</s></p>

				<div class="callout callout-info">
					<h5><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Important Note</h5>
					As of version <code>1.7.0</code>, I have stopped generating the compatibility version of the library.  All features are now supported by greater than 90% of browsers, so I feel it is no longer necessary.  This allows me to drop the babel dependency, as well as decrease the distribution size.  However, I have backed-up version 1.6.2 to an alternate branch in the unlikely event anyone still needs it.

				<h5>Requirements</h5>
				<p>Just <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_bootstrap">Bootstrap</a> version 5.0.1 or greater.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h5>Getting Started</h5>
				<p>The modbox library can be added to your project in several ways:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/bootstrap-modbox" target="_npm">NPM</a>:
						<pre>
							<code class="lang-plain">
								npm i bootstrap-modbox
							</code>
						</pre>
						<p>Although since it's client-side, if you're not using a bundler (eg. Webpack), you'll also have to copy the necessary <code>.js</code> file(s) from <code>node_modules/bootstrap-modbox/dist</code> into your project folder structure and include it in your page(s) like the examples below.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://unpkg.com/browse/bootstrap-modbox/" target="_unpkg">Unpkg CDN</a>:
						<pre>
							<code class="lang-html">
								&lt;!-- latest version -->
								&lt;script src="https://unpkg.com/bootstrap-modbox">&lt;/script>

								&lt;!-- specific version -->
								&lt;script src="https://unpkg.com/bootstrap-modbox@1.7.0/dist/bootstrap-modbox.min.js">&lt;/script>
							</code>
						</pre>
						<pre>
							<code class="lang-js">
								// latest version
								import modbox from 'https://unpkg.com/bootstrap-modbox/dist/bootstrap-modbox.esm.min.js';

								// specific version
								import modbox from 'https://unpkg.com/bootstrap-modbox@1.7.0/dist/bootstrap-modbox.esm.min.js';
							</code>
						</pre>
					</li>
					<li>
						Download from <a href="https://github.com/erobertson42/bootstrap-modbox/releases" target="_githubRel">GitHub</a>:
						<pre>
							<code class="lang-html">
								&lt;script src="dist/bootstrap-modbox.min.js">&lt;/script>
							</code>
						</pre>
						<pre>
							<code class="lang-js">
								import modbox from './dist/bootstrap-modbox.esm.min.js';
							</code>
						</pre>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h5>Notes</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p><b>Bootstrap ES module:</b></p>

						<p>Modbox will automatically attempt to locate a reference to Bootstrap in the global namespace.  If it does not exist, such as when loading Bootstrap
						as an ES module, you will also need to pass it as a reference to the <code>modbox.bootstrapModal</code> property before it can be used.</p>

						<pre>
							<code class="lang-js">
								import * as bootstrap from '/path/to/bootstrap.esm.min.js';
								import modbox from '/path/to/bootstrap-modbox.esm.min.js';
								modbox.bootstrapModal = bootstrap.Modal;
							</code>
						</pre>

						<p>... or ...</p>

						<pre>
							<code class="lang-js">
								import { Modal } from '/path/to/bootstrap.esm.min.js';
								import modbox from '/path/to/bootstrap-modbox.esm.min.js';
								modbox.bootstrapModal = Modal;
							</code>
						</pre>

						<p>Unfortunately, it is not as simple as automatically importing Bootstrap into the module version of modbox.  The ES standard module system requires
						a path to the file to be imported.  Meaning if I were to include it, I would have to hardcode the path, and anyone using modbox would either have to
						use that same path to Bootstrap, or modify the code with their own path - which is obviously not desirable.  Alternatively, if I imported Bootstrap
						using the specifier syntax (<code>import * as bootstrap from 'bootstrap'</code>), then a bundler like webpack would be required and no one could use
						the ES module version in a vanilla JavaScript environment (it would throw an error).</p>

						<p>A JavaScript <a href="https://github.com/WICG/import-maps/" target="_importMap">import map</a> could work, however, it is currently still an
						experimental feature and <a href="https://caniuse.com/import-maps" target="_importMapSup">not supported</a> by all browsers. For now, the above
						solution should be sufficient, and I have added a more descriptive error thrown if the <code>bootstrap</code> object is not found.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><b>Sanitization:</b></p>

						<p>This library builds its markup as a string, then uses the <code>element.insertAdjacentHTML()</code> method to parse and inject the
						resulting nodes into the DOM. There has been some concern shown for other libraries using similar methods
						(<code>element.insertHTML</code>, jQuery <code>$(element).html()</code>, etc) that this could be a potential XSS attack vector (eg. user
						submitted data), considering that custom markup can be passed as a string with some configuration options (title, body, etc).</p>

						<p>I understand this argument in theory, however in practice, I feel it's a non-issue. It should be the responsibility of
						each developer to handle such situations. If you're using user submitted data to build the markup for a modbox, it is on
						you to make sure the data is clean and safe. Handling this task is outside the scope of this library.</p>

						<p>So that said, I'm not going to take the time to write and maintain my own sanitizer, nor am I going to add an external
						dependency. However, as a compromise, I have added a <code>sanitizer</code> option that accepts a function, which can be from an
						external library like <a href="https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify" target="_blank">DOMPurify</a> (for example), should you wish to include/use one
						on your own. In addition, the <code>.prompt()</code> modal also has an <code>input.sanitizer</code> option that can clean the user input
						before being passed to the Promise resolve function. See the documentation for more details.</p>

						<p>Please note that if you use software which scans your code for vulnerabilities, the solution above will most likely not
						satisfy those scans, since markup is still permitted and the sanitizer is optional.</p>
